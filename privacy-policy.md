Privacy Policy

Thank you for using **Scap**! We highly value your privacy. This document explains how we handle your data when you use this app.

## Information Collection

**Scap** is a professional macOS application designed specifically for image screenshot capture, annotation, and drawing board creation. It provides a focused editing canvas that integrates multiple powerful features, including drawing tools, blur/mosaic, spotlight, QR code overlay, watermark, and image layer pasting. In addition to robust editing capabilities, Scap supports editing existing images, a free drawing board mode for creative projects, and a precise screenshot mode, helping users efficiently complete image processing tasks. All operations are performed locally on your device.

**Please Note:** This application is designed for image editing and annotation purposes. Please use the tools responsibly and respect copyright when editing and sharing images.

**Important Note:** Scap operates completely offline. It does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. The app does not connect to remote servers or integrate any third-party services.

### a. Local Data Processing

* All settings and operations are stored only on your local device.
* The app does not record your usage behavior or upload any data.

### b. No Logging

Scap does not generate or send any logs. All operations and configurations are performed locally, with no remote communication involved.

## Use of Data

Since Scap does not collect or store any user data, there is no use or sharing of data. All of your usage remains private and offline.

## Third-Party Services

Scap does not use any third-party analytics tools, advertising platforms, or cloud services, nor does it share or sell user information to any third party.
